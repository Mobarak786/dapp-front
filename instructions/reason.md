## 1. AI-Powered DeFi Assistant on Starknet

Hey! We built LeftCurve to solve a real pain point in DeFi - making complex trading strategies accessible to everyone. Our agents aren't just simple bots; they're full-fledged AI assistants that:

- Help users understand market conditions through natural conversations
- Break down complex trading decisions into clear, logical steps
- Actually execute trades on Starknet DEXes (Avnu, Paradex)
- Learn and adapt from their performance

The cool part? Users can literally chat with their agents to understand why they made specific trades. No more black box strategies.

## 2. Best AI Agent dApp on Starknet

Look, there are plenty of trading bots out there, but we're doing something different:

- Each agent has its own personality and trading style (thanks to Eliza framework)
- They run in isolated Docker containers for security
- They use chain-of-thought reasoning to make decisions
- Users can create, customize, and share their agents
- The whole thing runs on Starknet for speed and low costs

Plus, we've built a proper tokenomics system where successful agents generate value for their creators and investors. It's not just about the tech - it's about building a sustainable ecosystem.

## 3. Best Community dApp on Starknet

Here's why LeftCurve is fundamentally community-driven:

- Anyone can create and share trading agents
- Users can invest in agents they believe in
- Protocol fees are shared with the community
- Agents can interact with each other and learn from the community
- The platform gets better as more people join and create agents

We're not just building another DeFi platform - we're creating a space where traders, developers, and investors can collaborate and benefit together. Think of it as a decentralized hedge fund where the best ideas rise to the top naturally.
